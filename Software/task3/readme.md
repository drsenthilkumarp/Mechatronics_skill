# Calculator

## Task 3  
The objective of this task is to design and develop a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create an interactive web-based calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

This project focuses on using HTML to structure the calculator interface, CSS to design and style the layout for a clean and user-friendly experience, and JavaScript to implement the logic and interactivity behind the calculatorâ€™s operations.

The task aims to help learners understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and real-time user interaction through JavaScript, while also reinforcing concepts of responsive design and component-based layout using CSS.
